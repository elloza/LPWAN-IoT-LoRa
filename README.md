# LPWAN-IoT-LoRa
This repository includes all repositories and documents of the talk "LPWAN for IoT 2019". The instructions and links for demos are available In the slides.
# Demo 1: P2P LoRaChat with ESP32 TTGO v1
![Demo1]( https://github.com/elloza/LPWAN-IoT-LoRa/blob/master/img/psp2chat.jpg)
In this demo, I want to show an example of a simple P2P LoRa communication between 2 nodes.
The example is developed using Arduino.
# Demo 2: Simulating a LoRaWAN Node connected to TTN
![Demo2]( https://github.com/elloza/LPWAN-IoT-LoRa/blob/master/img/simulatingTTN.png)
In order to understand the communication between a LoRaWAN node and TTN I will use the [ARM Mbed OS Simulator]( http://ec2-52-211-146-247.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:7829/).
